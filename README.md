This is assignment #2 for my OpenGL Animation class, written in C.

It is a Solar System simulation that shows all of the planets rotating around the sun. As well as stars in the distance and a
space ship of the enterprise.

Requirements
------------

This program requires `C`, `freeGlut`, and `GLEW`.

This program is made to run in Visual Studio 2012, and you will have to configure the
freeglut libraries and linkers when running this on your own copy most likely.

A basic tutorial on how to get set up is found here [Setup](http://www.wyzant.com/resources/blogs/226103/opengl_freeglut_and_visual_studio_2012)

Installation
------------

1. Open the project in Visual studio, or grab the screensaver.c file and set it up in
   your own environment.
2. Ensure you have `freeGlut`, and `GLEW` installed properly. As well as all includes and static libraries linked

Making the Program Do Things
----------------------------

1. Run the Planets.exe found in the debug folder or run it in visual studio as a project.
2. View the output to console to see the various keys that control the program.
3. To exit the program just hit the exit button in the corner.
